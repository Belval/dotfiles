# dotfiles

My personal configs for git, vim, vscode, and zsh. Completed with a script to easily install them on a new machine.

## Installation

`./install.sh` if you already cloned the repository, else you can do:

`git clone https://github.com/Belval/dotfiles.git && chmod +x dotfiles/install.sh && cd dotfiles/ && ./install.sh`
